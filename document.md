### Face mask detection for video stream
- The project involves detecting face mask for an inputted mp4 video.
- MTCNN is used for face detection.
- Tensorflow is used for implementing the neural network.
- Main libraries that have been used are src, opencv, tensorflow

##### Instructions for executing the project -
- The videos to be inputted must be present in the directory named 'videos'
- Open the terminal in the directory named 'face_mask_detection'
- Install all the dependencies using `pip3 install -e`
- Start the project using the command `python3 start.py`
